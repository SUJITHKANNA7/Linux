`netstat` and `traceroute` are two valuable tools for network diagnostics and troubleshooting on Linux systems. Hereâ€™s an overview of each command, including their usages, options, and examples.

### **1. `netstat`**

`netstat` (network statistics) is a command-line tool that displays network connections, routing tables, interface statistics, masquerade connections, and multicast memberships. It helps monitor network performance and troubleshoot network issues.

#### **Common Options**

- **List Open Ports and Connections**
  ```sh
  netstat -tuln
  ```
  - **`-t`**: Show TCP connections.
  - **`-u`**: Show UDP connections.
  - **`-l`**: Show only listening sockets.
  - **`-n`**: Show numerical addresses instead of resolving hostnames.

- **Show Network Interfaces and Their Statistics**
  ```sh
  netstat -i
  ```
  - **`-i`**: Display a list of network interfaces and their statistics.

- **Show Routing Table**
  ```sh
  netstat -r
  ```
  - **`-r`**: Display the routing table.

- **Show Network Statistics**
  ```sh
  netstat -s
  ```
  - **`-s`**: Display network statistics by protocol (e.g., TCP, UDP).

- **Show All Active Connections**
  ```sh
  netstat -a
  ```
  - **`-a`**: Display all connections and listening ports.

- **Display Listening Ports with Process Information**
  ```sh
  netstat -tulnp
  ```
  - **`-p`**: Show the process ID and name of the program to which each socket belongs.

#### **Examples**

- **List All Listening Ports and Connections**:
  ```sh
  netstat -tuln
  ```

- **Show Active TCP Connections**:
  ```sh
  netstat -tn
  ```

- **Display Routing Table**:
  ```sh
  netstat -r
  ```

- **Show Network Interface Statistics**:
  ```sh
  netstat -i
  ```

### **2. `traceroute`**

`traceroute` is a network diagnostic tool used to trace the path that packets take from one host to another. It helps determine where network delays or failures are occurring.

#### **Common Options**

- **Basic Usage**
  ```sh
  traceroute example.com
  ```

- **Specify a Different Protocol (e.g., UDP)**
  ```sh
  traceroute -u example.com
  ```
  - **`-u`**: Use UDP packets instead of ICMP (default).

- **Specify the Maximum Number of Hops**
  ```sh
  traceroute -m 20 example.com
  ```
  - **`-m`**: Set the maximum number of hops (TTL).

- **Set the Timeout for Each Probe**
  ```sh
  traceroute -w 2 example.com
  ```
  - **`-w`**: Set the timeout (in seconds) for each probe.

- **Use a Specific Port Number**
  ```sh
  traceroute -p 80 example.com
  ```
  - **`-p`**: Specify the port number for UDP packets.

#### **Examples**

- **Trace the Route to a Domain**
  ```sh
  traceroute google.com
  ```

- **Trace the Route to an IP Address**
  ```sh
  traceroute 8.8.8.8
  ```

- **Trace Route Using UDP Packets**
  ```sh
  traceroute -u example.com
  ```

- **Limit the Number of Hops**
  ```sh
  traceroute -m 10 example.com
  ```

### **Comparison and Use Cases**

- **`netstat`**:
  - **Usage**: Primarily used to display network connections, listening ports, routing tables, and interface statistics.
  - **Use Case**: Monitoring and troubleshooting network connections, checking which ports are in use, and identifying which processes are using network sockets.

- **`traceroute`**:
  - **Usage**: Traces the path packets take to reach a destination, showing each hop along the way and the time taken.
  - **Use Case**: Diagnosing network routing issues, identifying network bottlenecks, and determining the path of data across the network.

### **Summary**

- **`netstat`**:
  - **Commands**: `netstat -tuln`, `netstat -i`, `netstat -r`, `netstat -s`
  - **Purpose**: Display network connections, routing tables, and interface statistics.

- **`traceroute`**:
  - **Commands**: `traceroute example.com`, `traceroute -u example.com`, `traceroute -m 20 example.com`
  - **Purpose**: Trace the route packets take to a destination and diagnose network path issues.

Both `netstat` and `traceroute` are essential tools for network diagnostics and troubleshooting, providing insights into network behavior and helping identify and resolve issues.
